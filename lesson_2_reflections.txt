What happens when you initialize a repo?
It creates a hidden folder named .git which contains metadata of given repository
There are no commits initially
The branch is master
git status shows that there are no commits to the repo

staging area
to commit the changes in diffrent files using diffrent commits staging area is used
git add command is used to add changes to staging area
when two files are changed at the same time but have diffrent logicall changes staging area can be useful

when to use branches
Precisely when you need to add a feature or make change which u think is not oficially part of project
To keep the original version intact and experiment with it using diffrent branch
