What happens when you initialize a repo?
It creates a hidden folder named .git which contains metadata of given repository
There are no commits initially
The branch is master
git status shows that there are no commits to the repo

staging area
to commit the changes in diffrent files using diffrent commits staging area is used
git add command is used to add changes to staging area
when two files are changed at the same time but have diffrent logicall changes staging area can be useful

when to use branches
Precisely when you need to add a feature or make change which u think is not oficially part of project
To keep the original version intact and experiment with it using diffrent branch

how do diagram help to visualize branch structure
Branch structure is like a tree
each new commit is a new node
this new node points to the previous commit 
This refrence is used to create a git log
Diagram can show what commits are present in  a given branch 
also it can help identify unreachable nodes(commits)

Merge branches
In order to add cod eof one branch to other merge command is used
The merge feature automatically adds code of two branches using the latest commits and the common parent
the new merge commits point to two prievious branch heads thus it has two parents 

Merge conflicts
Automatic merging doesn't always work.Sometimes it is too difficult for git to figure out which changes to keep or remove
In such a case user can resolve conflicts .
