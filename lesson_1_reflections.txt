1)The basic form of version control is manually saving files
2)some softwares such as dropbox ,google docs save previous versions
3)Dropbox saves it only for 30hrs
4)wikipedia pages also have there previous versions saved

desired properties for version control
1)frequency of saving a version-It is often useful to save a version after a suitable logical change in code is made.git allows you to do so

pros of manual commits in git 
manual commit can diffrentiate between two commits logically
also it is according to our prefrences

cons of manual saving
sometimes it is difficult to decide whether the change is criticall or not
also due to human errors we might skip some commits

Saving multiple files
git is a development vcs so it facilitates multiple files changes as it is often the case that when we change a single function we ought to change function calls in another files
google docs doesn't support it 

Viewing history of files in git
git log and git diff are two commands useful for viewing history 
history can be very useful to revert to a older version 
Also it is useful in finding bugs

checkout command
The command is used to revert to a previous version of a project
Hence if you break something it doesn't matter as you need not go on undoing ur work
